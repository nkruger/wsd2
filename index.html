			<p>Come join us on Saturday, December 22, 2012, at 7:00 p.m. for the annual <strong>Tinytown Christmas Parade! </strong>Just like last year, we will be starting at the corner of Main street and 22nd Ave. and heading up to the square before turning down Market street and ending two blocks past the Courthouse. The lights along the parade path will be amazing this year because everyone in the downtown professional community has really become involved in the new <em>Business Christmas Decoration Competition</em> sponsored by the First Bank of Tinytown.</p>

			<h2>Register Your Group Today!</h2>
			<p>We still have plenty of room in the parade for more participants in this years parade. Businesses, Non-profits, schools, and clubs are all welcome to enter floats. This is great opportunity to get the name of your organization some positive publicity within the local community.</p>
			<p>Positions in the parade are first come, first serve. The earlier you sign up the more likely you will be to get your preferred spot. If you are planning on using a lot of music or sound effects with your float you don't want to be stuck behind the high school marching band like the Tinytown Orchid Club was last year (Yes, they made sure they signed up early this year, you should too!).</p>

			<h3>Looking for Volunteers</h3>
			<p>Because of cuts to the city budget, we don't have the money to pay the city workers holiday overtime to work the parade this year. We need help setting up the parade route and breaking it down afterwards.</p>
			<section>
				<p>All volunteers will get these perks for helping make our parade a success:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>A T-shirt commemorating the parade</li>
					<li>An invitation to the after party at the community center</li>
					<li>A warm and fuzzy feeling inside</li>
				</ul>

			<h2>Highlights from Last Year</h2>
			<p>We had a great turnout last year, considering we thought we would be rained out up until a couple of hours before the parade started. Mayor Schmidt was supposed to lead the parade on foot, but unfortunately broke his foot in an unfortunate event involving a puggle and a ladder earlier in the day. Dr. Edward Jones was kind enough to drive the Mayor in his Model-T Ford.</p>
